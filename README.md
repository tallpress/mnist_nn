First attempt writing a neural network, using the MNIST dataset, to detect handwritten numbers.

I read the first two chapters of neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com then attempted the MNIST challenge myself using the notes I took from the book.
src/mnist_loader.py is a direct copy from from neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com
